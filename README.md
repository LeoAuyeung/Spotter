## What it does
Spotter is a web app that helps you find and connect with gym partners.
The application allows you to find other people in the area who want to work out, and potentially even go to their same gym to work out together with.
Spotter comes from having a person “spot” or help watch over you while you perform a lift.

## Why Spotter?
We want to ease beginners into working out.
By connecting you with strangers who share the goal of working out with a partner, people can familiarize themselves at their own pace.
People using the app may be at different experience levels, and ideally we can help foster teacher-student gym relationships.

## How we built it
### Front-end:
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Redux

### Back-end:
- NodeJS/NPM
- PostgreSQL (database)

## To run locally:
### Requirements
You must have `npm` installed on your computer: [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Front-end:
Change into the `client` directory (`cd client` from the root directory)

Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.

Run `npm start`, and the client will be hosted on `localhost:3000`.

### Back-end:
In the root directory, install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.

Run `npm start`, and the server will be hosted on `localhost:5000`.
